## Abstract

Throughout the years, music has changed a lot. From the mid 1950's when rock n roll was popular, to today’s rnb and rap, music is an essential part of our lives. Our main question is what has influenced the change of music throughout the years.

No more than three sentences that summarize your project. Focus on the very most important aspects. For example: (1) "Our main question is .... This question is important because .... To address the question, we will ...." (2) "We are concerned with ..., because .... To address this concern, we plan to ...." (3) "Consider that .... This is important because .... Accordingly, we plan to ...."

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

Music is an essential part of our lives. Whether we are studying, working out, hanging with friends, music is always there. The presence of music helps us when we are sad, motivates us when we’re lazy, and can calm us down. However, today’s popular music genres are not the same as when our grandparents were kids. When our grandparents were kids, they listened to rock n roll in the 1950’s. Nowadays, we listened to all sorts of music with R&B/hip-hop, Latin, rock, pop, and world music accounting for the top five most popular genres. What has influenced all these music changes throughout the years? What rolls do political, sociological, and economical challenges play in the popular music genres throughout the years? When we are sad, we listen to soft music and when we are happy, we listen to upbeat music. Music choice is chosen based off of one’s mood. Could emotions caused by daily life challenges be a player in the changes of popular music genres? It is important to track these trends because over the course of the past century, so much has changed and happened in our world. Tracking music trends can help us analyze what people were feeling at the time and take a peek into what life was like for each century.

4. Implications

The results from our project aim to show and analyze the music trends since the 1900s, up until now. The data is important in terms of understanding how music has changed over the years, relative to various decades but also in absolute terms for how different music was in the 1900s versus today in 2023. But also it has potential, deep implications for sociological, cultural, and political reasons. Tied to certain events and eras, it will be interesting to see the changes in music in the eras of the roaring ‘20s, the Great Depression, Civil Rights movement, and the overall clearly defined cultures that surrounded the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s as decades. Based on the findings, it could help inform the impact of music on the broader culture and possible politics of the time period — as well as help inform and predict (possibly) how trends in music might change in the decades to come.

5. Limitations & Challenges

Given that we’re looking at a long span of music reaching back to the 1900s to now, it’s hard to really address the intricacies of the entire range of music people consumed over the years. We’re definitely looking at things with a more broad, top level approach and some trends might be missed. This is something to keep in mind as we look at the data and consider the trends we look at. It’s also very possible that there could be confounding variables that we miss out on when looking at how music has changed over the years. Music and culture can be volatile when it comes to pinpointing reasons for trends. So in general, it’ll be important to keep an attention to detail, and take a look at all the different categories in our dataset, in order to make the most informed observations and analysis about the topic.
