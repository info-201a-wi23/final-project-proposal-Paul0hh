## Abstract

Our main question is how do music trends reflect patterns in society? This question is important because the music people consume has a deep tie to their opinions and emotions, which can change when large events happen in the world. We are concerned with music trends and how they changed around major world events because it can reflect the mindset that people may have had at the time.

## Keywords

Music trends, user consumption, pop culture.

## Proposal

1. Introduction  

Music is an essential part of our lives. Whether we are studying, working out, hanging with friends, music is always there. The presence of music helps us when we are sad, motivates us when we’re lazy, and can calm us down. However, today’s popular music genres are not the same as when our grandparents were kids. When our grandparents were kids, they listened to rock n roll in the 1950’s. Nowadays, we listened to all sorts of music with R&B/hip-hop, Latin, rock, pop, and world music accounting for the top five most popular genres. What has influenced all these music changes throughout the years? What rolls do political, sociological, and economical challenges play in the popular music genres throughout the years? When we are sad, we listen to soft music and when we are happy, we listen to upbeat music. Music choice is chosen based off of one’s mood. Could emotions caused by daily life challenges be a player in the changes of popular music genres? It is important to track these trends because over the course of the past century, so much has changed and happened in our world. Tracking music trends can help us analyze what people were feeling at the time and take a peek into what life was like for each century. 

2. Related Work  

This project will be looking at music trends throughout the years. Music trends can reflect broader events and patterns in society, such as the rise of social media, changing perceptions of the world, political unrest, economical changes, and great tragedies. Listening to music also has a deeply psychological effect, and can impact the listener’s mindset, mood, energy levels, stress levels, and memory. Christopher Rea’s study (2010) focused on the correlation between certain music genres and people’s mood, by recording participants’ moods before and after listening to music genres such as rock, classical, and pop. Stefan Hall’s article (2020) describes the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the music industry, such as the increase in broadcasted live performances, the changes in the global music industry’s revenue, and changes in advertising for newly released music. Kamran Ahmed’s article discusses the impact of historical events on the music industry (2022), such as the first ever music academy being built, the Romanticism cultural movement, and the Renaissance. Recording music trends is important because it can reflect broader themes than what meets the eye: oftentimes, changes in music’s genre and style often goes hand in hand with the mindsets of the people listening to the music. This can be caused by the changing world and sentiments as time progresses.

4. Implications

The results from our project aim to show and analyze the music trends since the 1900s, up until now. The data is important in terms of understanding how music has changed over the years, relative to various decades but also in absolute terms for how different music was in the 1900s versus today in 2023. But also it has potential, deep implications for sociological, cultural, and political reasons. Tied to certain events and eras, it will be interesting to see the changes in music in the eras of the roaring ‘20s, the Great Depression, Civil Rights movement, and the overall clearly defined cultures that surrounded the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s as decades. Based on the findings, it could help inform the impact of music on the broader culture and possible politics of the time period — as well as help inform and predict (possibly) how trends in music might change in the decades to come.

5. Limitations & Challenges

Given that we’re looking at a long span of music reaching back to the 1900s to now, it’s hard to really address the intricacies of the entire range of music people consumed over the years. We’re definitely looking at things with a more broad, top level approach and some trends might be missed. This is something to keep in mind as we look at the data and consider the trends we look at. It’s also very possible that there could be confounding variables that we miss out on when looking at how music has changed over the years. Music and culture can be volatile when it comes to pinpointing reasons for trends. So in general, it’ll be important to keep an attention to detail, and take a look at all the different categories in our dataset, in order to make the most informed observations and analysis about the topic.
